## 🧐 About
This is an implementation of libc functions from scratch. This project is part of 42 École/ 42 SP curriculum.\
Topics such as memory allocation, ASCII table, string manipulation, and others were addressed.

## 🏁 Getting Started
A C compiler such as `gcc` or `clang` is needed.

#### ⚙️ Installing
To compile the entire library, clone the repo, and run the commad `make`.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/filipebafica/libft.git
$ cd libft/source
$ make
```
This is going to generate a `libft.a` file that you can compile with your source code.
```
$ gcc my_source.c libft.a
$ ./a.out
```
## 🎈 How to Use
Just call the desired function (go to [Available Functions and Descriptions](#-available-functions-and-descriptions) to see all available functions).
```
ft_split("split-this-for-me-!",'-');
```
#### 👁️‍🗨️ Demonstration
To see a demonstration go to the demo folder, and compile the demo of the desired function (just add `_demo` to the end of function's name).
```
$ cd libft/demos
$ gcc ft_split_demo.c ../libft/libft.a
$ ./a.out
```
## 📋 Available Functions and Descriptions
| Function  | Prototype | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| ft_atoi  | `int	ft_atoi(const char *nptr)` | Converts the initial portion of the string pointed to by nptr to int. |
| ft_bzero  | `void	ft_bzero(void *s, size_t n)` | Erases the data in the n bytes of the memory starting at the location pointed to by s, by writing zeroes (bytes containing '\0') to that area. |
| ft_calloc | `void	*ft_calloc(size_t nmemb, size_t size)` | Allocates memory for an array of nmemb elements of size bytes each and returns a pointer  to  the  allocated memory.  The memory is set to zero. |
| ft_isalnum | `int	ft_isalnum(int c)` | Checks for an alphanumeric character. |
| ft_isalpha | `int	ft_isalpha(int c)` | Checks for an alphabetic character. |
| ft_isascii | `int	ft_isascii(int c)` | Checks whether c is a 7-bit unsigned char value that fits into the ASCII character set. |
| ft_isdigit | `int	ft_isdigit(int c)` | Checks for a digit (0 through 9). |
| ft_isprint | `int	ft_isprint(int c)` | Checks for any printable character including space. |
| ft_itoa | `char	*ft_itoa(int n)` | Returns a string representing the integer received as an argument. |
| ft_memccpy | `void	*ft_memccpy(void *dest, const void *src, int c, size_t n)` | Copies no more than n bytes from memory area src to memory area dest, stopping when the character c is found. |
| ft_memchr | `void	*ft_memchr(const void *s, int c, size_t n)` | Scans the initial n bytes of the memory area pointed to by s for the first instance of c. Returns a pointer to the matching byte or NULL if the character does not occur in the given memory area. |
| ft_memcmp | `int	ft_memcmp(const void *s1, const void *s2, size_t n)` | Compares the first n bytes. Returns an integer less than, equal to, or greater than zero if the first n bytes of s1 is found. |
| ft_memcpy | `void	*ft_memcpy(void *dest, const void *src, size_t n)` | Copies n bytes from memory area src to memory area dest. |
| ft_memmove | `void	*ft_memmove(void *dest, const void *src, size_t len)` | Copies n bytes from memory area src to memory area dest. The memory areas may overlap. |
| ft_memset | `void	*ft_memset(void *s, int c, size_t n)` | Fills the first n bytes of the memory area pointed to by s with the constant byte c. |
| ft_putchar_fd | `void	ft_putchar_fd(char c, int fd)` | Outputs the character ’c’ to the given file descriptor. |
| ft_putendl_fd | `void	ft_putendl_fd(char *s, int fd)` | Outputs the string ’s’ to the given file descriptor, followed by a newline. |
| ft_putnbr_fd | `void	ft_putnbr_fd(int n, int fd)` | Outputs the integer ’n’ to the given file descriptor. |
| ft_putstr_fd | `void	ft_putstr_fd(char *s, int fd)` | Outputs the string ’s’ to the given file descriptor. |
| ft_split | `char	**ft_split(char const *s, char c)` | Returns an array of strings obtained by splitting ’s’ using the character ’c’ as a delimiter. |
| ft_strchr | `char	*ft_strchr(const char *s, int c)`| Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the character c in the string s. |
| ft_strdup | `char	*ft_strdup(const char *s)` | Returns a pointer to a new string which is a duplicate of the string s. |
| ft_strjoin | `char	*ft_strjoin(char const *s1, char const *s2)` | Returns a new string, which is the result of the concatenation of ’s1’ and ’s2’. |
| ft_strlcat | `size_t	ft_strlcat(char *dest, const char *src, size_t size)` | Appends the NUL-terminated string src to the end of dst. It will append at most size - ft_strlen(dst) - 1 bytes, NUL-terminating the result. |
| ft_strlcpy | `size_t	ft_strlcpy(char *dst, const char *src, size_t size)` | Copies up to size - 1 characters from the NUL-terminated string src to dst, NUL-terminating the result. |
| ft_strlen | `size_t	ft_strlen(const char *s)` | Calculates the length of the string pointed to by s, excluding the terminating null byte ('\0'). |
| ft_strmapi | `char	*ft_strmapi(char const *s, char (*f)(unsigned int, char))` | Applies the function ’f’ to each character of the string ’s’ to create a new string. |
| ft_strncmp | `int	ft_strncmp(const char *s1, const char *s2, size_t n)` | Compares only the first (at most) n bytes of s1 and s2. It returns an integer less than, equal to, or greater than zero if s1 is found. |
| ft_strnstr | `char	*ft_strnstr(const char *big, const char *little, size_t len)` | Locates the first occurrence of the null-terminated string little in the string big. |
| ft_strrchr | `char	*ft_strrchr(const char *s, int c)` | Returns a pointer to the last occurrence of the character c in the string s. |
| ft_strtrim | `char	*ft_strtrim(char const *s1, char const *set)` |  Returns a copy of ’s1’ with the characters specified in ’set’ removed from the beginning and the end of the string. |
| ft_substr | `char	*ft_substr(char const *s, unsigned int start, size_t len)` | Returns a substring from the string ’s’. The substring begins at index ’start’ and is ofmaximum size ’len’. |
| ft_tolower | `int	ft_tolower(int c)` | Returns its lowercase equivalent. |
| ft_toupper | `int	ft_toupper(int c)` | Returns its uppercasse equivalent. |
